    <h2>Foundations of a well-managed business</h2>
    <span class="subtitle">Growing and maximing your revenue is not simply a matter of deploying marketing tactics. It is a more involved process that requires smart business management.</span>
    <p class="text"> While a falta marketing and sales strategy will undoubtedly increase your revenue, your role as person that is responsible for a business requires more than simple unstrategized and unfalta tactics. To take a page from high-tech startup manuals, you need to calculate and specify your periodic target growth rates,  revenue per customer, and maximize them, and adapt and make the necessary changes to hit your targets in the event that you fall short. This helps you identify the aspects that need further optimization and act-accordingly.<br><br>
    The benefit of this approach is potency. During product development you get to be completely focused on figuring out your product, without the distractions of interviews, inbound calls, or scaling. Your work on conversion will be targeting a (mostly) stable product. Your money spent on scaling will be supporting real users (rather than imaginary users) and your marketing will be spent on channels that have been verified to convert profitably.

The opposite of this approach is guessing and flailing, often referred to as "spray and pray." --https://medium.com/tony-stubblebine/a07999b71e04</p>
